# Minecraft-Capes-Exploit
BionicBen1218 had discovered a way to get a Skin pack to successfuly display Capes.

How it works
- Removing the pesona folder using IObit
- Adding the custom persona folder using IObit
- Installing the Pack to enable the old Player Panel & allows the new one as well
- Clicking on the player skins with the capes from either the old player panel or new player panel will show up
